    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: January 4, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your
        information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.</p>
    <p><strong>Degauss</strong> is designed as a "Digital Detox" tool. We prioritize your privacy and aim to collect as
        little data as possible to provide the Service.</p>

    <h2>INTERPRETATION AND DEFINITIONS</h2>
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <p>The words of which the initial letter is capitalized have meanings defined under the following conditions. The
        following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or in plural.
    </p>

    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account</strong> means a unique account created for You to access our Service or parts of our
            Service. (Note: Degauss does not currently require User Accounts).</li>
        <li><strong>Application</strong> refers to Degauss, the software program provided by the Company.</li>
        <li><strong>Company</strong> (referred to as either "the Company", "We", "Us" or "Our" in this Agreement) refers
            to Ali Amanvermez.</li>
        <li><strong>Country</strong> refers to: Turkey</li>
        <li><strong>Device</strong> means any device that can access the Service such as a computer, a cellphone or a
            digital tablet.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Data</strong> is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Service</strong> refers to the Application.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong> refers to data collected automatically, either generated by the use of the
            Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a focus session).</li>
        <li><strong>You</strong> means the individual accessing or using the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>COLLECTING AND USING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
    <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>

    <h4>Personal Data</h4>
    <p>While using Our Service, We generally do <strong>NOT</strong> ask You to provide specific personally identifiable
        information (such as Email or Phone Number) because the App functions offline and locally.</p>

    <h4>Usage Data</h4>
    <p>Usage Data is generated when using the Service.</p>
    <p>Degauss stores your Focus Session history, Statistics (e.g., total focus time), and Generated Artifacts locally
        on your Device using Apple's Core Data and UserDefaults technologies.</p>
    <p>We do not upload this data to a central server. It remains on your device unless you choose to back it up via
        iCloud backups or share specific items manually.</p>

    <h4>Information Collected while Using the Application</h4>
    <p>While using Our Application, in order to provide features of Our Application, We may request access to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> To verify or save generated Artifacts (images) to your device's gallery.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To alert you when a focus timer completes.</li>
        <li><strong>Motion Activity:</strong> To detect when the phone is placed face-down (for the "De-gauss"
            mechanic).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can enable or disable access to this information at any time, through Your Device settings.</p>

    <h3>Use of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>The Company may use Personal Data (if any is collected) for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To provide and maintain our Service</strong>, including to monitor the usage of our Service.</li>
        <li><strong>To manage Your requests:</strong> To attend and manage Your requests to Us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Retention of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this
        Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Since Degauss is an offline-first app, your data is primarily retained on your local device. If you delete the
        App, your local data (Artifacts, Stats) will be deleted unless backed up to iCloud.</p>

    <h2>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
        information from anyone under the age of 13.</p>

    <h2>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third party link,
        You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every
        site You visit.</p>

    <h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
    <p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy
        Policy on this page.</p>
