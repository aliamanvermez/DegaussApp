    <p><strong>Last updated: January 4, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the <strong>Degauss</strong>
        mobile application (the "App") operated by Ali Amanvermez ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using the App you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms
        then you may not access the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Degauss is a mobile application designed to aid focus and digital well-being through gamified timers and
        generative art rewards. The App is provided for personal, non-commercial use.</p>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App and its original content (code, design, assets), excluding user-generated data, are and will remain the
        exclusive property of Ali Amanvermez.</p>
    <p><strong>Artifacts:</strong> The digital images ("Artifacts") generated by the App are created for your personal

    <ul>
        <li>Safeguarding your device to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        <li>Backing up your data (e.g., via iCloud), as Degauss stores data locally and we cannot restore lost data.

    <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
    <p>The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied,

        damages, including without limitation, loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from
        your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. By continuing to
        access or use our App after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
